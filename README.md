## A-Frame Testes

### Installation
First make sure you have Phython installed.

Running python -m SimpleHTTPServer (or python -m http.server for Python 3) in a terminal in the same directory as your HTML file. Once we are running our server, we can open our project in the browser using the local URL and port which the server is running on (e.g., http://localhost:8000). Try not to open the project using the file:// protocol which does not provide a domain; absolute and relative URLs may not work.

You have to host on a secured server to use on mobile. or access:
